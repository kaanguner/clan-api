DWH Architecture: Medallion Model

This document describes the Data Warehouse architecture, which follows the Medallion model (Bronze, Silver, Gold).

---------------------------------
|         BRONZE LAYER          |
| (Raw, Untouched Source Data)  |
---------------------------------
             |
             v
---------------------------------
|         SILVER LAYER          |
| (Cleaned, Conformed Data)     |
---------------------------------
             |
             v
---------------------------------
|          GOLD LAYER           |
| (Analytics-Ready Data Marts)  |
---------------------------------

Data Flow:

1.  **Bronze Layer:**
    *   Table: `raw_user_metrics`
    *   Description: Raw, immutable data ingested directly from the source systems.

2.  **Silver Layer:**
    *   Table: `stg_user_daily_metrics`
    *   Description: Data from the Bronze layer is cleaned, standardized, and prepared for modeling. This includes casting data types, renaming columns, and basic data quality checks.

3.  **Gold Layer:**
    *   Tables: `dim_date`, `dim_platform`, `dim_country`, `dim_user`, `fact_daily_user_activity`
    *   Description: This is the dimensional model (star schema) that serves as the primary data mart for analytics. It's optimized for querying and easy to understand for business users.
    *   Table: `daily_metrics`
    *   Description: An aggregated mart built on top of the dimensional model, providing pre-calculated business metrics like DAU and ARPDAU for reporting and dashboards.
