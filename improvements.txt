hey,

so i looked at the clan api thing, and it's looking pretty good. everything works like it's supposed to, and using fastapi is a good call. the secret manager integration is also a nice touch.

here are just a few ideas for making it even better, more like what you'd see in a bigger production app.

1. using sqlalchemy

right now you're using psycopg2 directly. which is fine, but sqlalchemy would be a good next step. it's an ORM, which means you can work with your database using python classes instead of raw sql. it helps with keeping things organized and can prevent some common bugs. you could define your 'clans' table as a python class in models.py.

2. database connection pool

another thing is the database connection. you're making a new connection for every request. this can be slow if you get a lot of traffic. a connection pool would be better. it keeps a bunch of connections open and reuses them. fastapi can help you set this up with its dependency injection system. it's way more efficient.

3. cleaning up

just a small thing, the requirements.txt has sqlalchemy but you're not using it. if you dont end up using it, you should probably remove it. and there are still a few extra files in the main directory. cleaning those up would make the project look tidier.

anyway, these are just some suggestions. the app is already solid.

cheers,
